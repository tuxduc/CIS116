<p>This is my repo and it is really cool!

Tips from Quynn:
- you must add a commetn before you commit!
- Why you dont want auto pull: your progress can be overwritten by other users. (manual pull will allow you to choose what additions to incorperate)
- DONT EDIT WITHIN GITHUB YOU KNOB!

General Process:
